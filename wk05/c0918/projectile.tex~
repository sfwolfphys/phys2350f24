  By the end of this activity, you should be able to \ldots
  \begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item Describe the motion of objects moving in the same direction as a constant applied force.
    \item Describe the motion of objects moving under the influence of a constant applied
    force.
    \item Interpret data related to the motion of falling objects.
  \end{enumerate}

\section*{Kenyan Pirates \textrm{I}}
\subsection*{Alternate title: You mean, Pirates were the bad guys?!?!?}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!5!white,colframe=white!15!black,title=Problem Context]
  While on a vacation to Kenya, you visit the port city of Mombassa on the Indian Ocean. On the
  coast, you find an old Portuguese fort probably built in the 16\textsuperscript{th}
  century. Large stone walls rise vertically from the shore to protect the fort from cannon
  fire from pirate ships.  You wonder how close a pirate ship would have to sail to the fort to
  be in range of the fort's cannon. Of course you realize that the range depends on the
  velocity that the cannonball leaves the cannon.
\end{tcolorbox}

  \subsection*{Your mission}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Measure the height of the cliff.
    \item Determine the muzzle velocity for the cannon.
  \end{itemize}
  This mission will continue later this week\ldots\\

  There is also an observation post with a view of the fort looking out to the ocean shown
  at the right

  \end{center}
\end{minipage}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item If you were to drop a rock out of the gun hole, write an algebraic expression relating
  the height of the cliff $H$ to the time it would take for the rock to hit the water
  $t_{\text{rock}}$, and any constants you might need (e.g., $g$, $\pi$, or regular
  numbers). \vspace{0.75in} 
  \item If you fired the cannon horizontally, how would the time it takes the cannonball to hit
  the water $t_{\text{ball}}$ compare to $t_{\text{rock}}$?  Explain. \vspace{0.5in}
  \item If you fired the cannon horizontally, write an algebraic expression for the horizontal
  distance traveled $D$ in terms of the time in air $t_{\text{ball}}$ and the (unknown) muzzle
  velocity $\left|\vec{v}_0\right| = v_0$.
\end{enumerate}

  Leaning out of one of these gun holes, you drop a rock which hits the ocean 3.0 seconds
  later. (Repeating this action multiple times, you reproduce the same time within 0.2 seconds,
  a typical human reaction time.)

  At your disposal, the Kenyan Navy has provided you with a generous supply of both standard
  charges to fire a cannonball, and cannonballs, each a standard mass of 4 kg.  You have also
  set up an observation post on the water, which will allow you to observe the splash and
  measure the distances $D$ and $H$ indicated above using still photographs of the splash.  You
  decide to fire the cannon horizontally 5 times and collect distance measurement data.  Since
  you only have photographs, all distance measurements are in \textit{pixels} and displayed in
  the table below.
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{l|rrrrr}
      Trial \# &1 &2 &3 &4 &5 \\
      \hline
      $H$(px) &220 &223 &222 &222 &225 \\
      $D$(px) &1122 &1138 &1133 &1134 &1145 \\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection*{Results and interpretations}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Based on the observations, what is the height of the cliff (in m)? \vspace{1in}
  \item Based on the observations, how far away does the cannonball land (in m)? \vspace{1in}
  \item Use these measurements to determine the muzzle velocity of the cannon (in m/s).  Show
  your work. Compare this speed to the speed of an object that you are familiar with.
\end{enumerate}

  complete this on your own before then if it isn't done in class.}
