\section{Applying Newton's laws to a system with friction}
Suppose that a block slides down a fixed, inclined plane with $\theta=\SI{30}{\deg}$.  You have
analyzed the material of the block and the plane previously and have found that they have a
coefficient of kinetic friction of $\mu_k = 0.3$.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item In the space below, draw a free-body diagram for the block just after it has been
  released from rest. You should ensure that your diagram is accurate in the direction that the
  forces point, but it need not have accurate force magnitudes.  All important angles should be
  labeled. \vspace{1.5in}
  \item In the space below, sketch a qualitatively correct graph of velocity vs. time $(v$ vs.\
  $t)$ for the block.  You should assume that the block is released from rest at $t=0$ and the
  velocity is positive if it is moving down the ramp.
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[>=stealth]
      \draw[<->] (-1,0) -- (10,0) node [right]{$t$}; \draw[<->] (0,-1) -- (0,5) node
      [left]{$v$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  \item On the same set of axes above, show the $v$ vs. $t$ graph that \textit{would have been}
  correct if there was \textit{no} friction.  Make sure that both graphs are consistent with
  each other and be prepared to defend your rationale to another group/the instructor. \vfill
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Now let's see if we can go from qualitative predictions to quantitative predictions.
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
  \item Copy your free-body diagram from part (a) in the space below.  What coordinate system
  will you use for this problem? Show how it will be oriented on your free-body diagram on the
  previous page and defend your choice in the space below. \vspace{2in}
  \item Break down your forces into components along each direction of your coordinate system
  of choice.  Relate the net force to the acceleration in each direction and simplify your
  result. \vspace{0.1in}

  \vspace{0.75in}
  \item Simplify the equations above and solve for the acceleration of the block $a$.
  \vspace{0.75in}
  \item Ensure that the previous result matches the $v$ vs.\ $t$ graph that
  you drew in part (b). Resolve any inconsistencies.

\section{Applying Newton's laws to a system with friction}
Suppose that a block is at the bottom of a fixed, inclined plane with $\theta=\SI{30}{\deg}$.  You have
analyzed the material of the block and the plane previously and have found that they have a
coefficient of kinetic friction of $\mu_k = 0.3$. The block is initially given a quick shove up the ramp.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item In the space below, draw a free-body diagram for the block just after it has been
  shoved up the ramp. You should ensure that your diagram is accurate in the direction that the
  forces point, but it need not have accurate force magnitudes.  All important angles should be
  labeled. \vspace{1.5in}
  \item In the space below, sketch a qualitatively correct graph of velocity vs. time $(v$ vs.\
  $t)$ for the block.  You should assume that the block is moving at speed $v_0$ after the
  shove has finished at $t=0$ and the velocity is positive if it is moving up the ramp.

% \section{Air Resistance and Newton's Second Law}
% Suppose that you took a small rubber ball to the top of a very tall building and dropped it
% from rest at $t=0$. At a later time $t=t_0$, the ball moves with \textit{constant speed}. (The
% constant speed eventually reached by the falling ball is called the \textit{terminal speed}.)
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item In the space provided below, draw separate free-body diagrams for the ball (i) at
%   $t=0$, and (ii) at $t=t_0$.  Clearly label all forces. \vfill

%   What can be said about the acceleration of the ball (i) at $t=0$? (ii) at $t=t_0$? Discuss
%   both magnitude and direction.  Explain how you can use your free-body diagrams above to
%   support your answers. \vfill
%   \item In the space below, sketch a qualitatively correct graph of velocity vs.\ time ($v$
%   vs.\ $t$) for the ball.  On your graph, clearly label the instant $t=t_0$ on the horizontal
%   axis.
%   \begin{center}
%     \begin{tikzpicture}[>=stealth]
%       \draw[<->] (-1,0) -- (10,0) node [right]{$t$};
%       \draw[<->] (0,-1) -- (0,5) node [left]{$v$};
%     \end{tikzpicture}
%   \end{center}
%   On the same set of axes above, show the $v$ vs.\ $t$ graph that \textit{would have been}
%   correct if there were \textit{no} air resistance.  Make sure your graph is consistent with
%   your first $v$ vs.\ $t$ graph.  Describe in words how you made sure that both $v$ vs.\ $t$
%   graphs were consistent with each other. \vfill
%   \newpage
%   \item Now imagine releasing the rubber ball at shoulder level so that the ball drops to the
%   floor and bounces back straight up. Suppose that the upward speed of the ball immediately
%   after it leaves the floor were \textit{exactly equal} to its downward speed immediately
%   before it reaches the floor.  (Assume the ball never reaches terminal speed, but continue to
%   take air resistance into account.)
%   \begin{center}
%     \begin{tikzpicture}[>=stealth]
%       \draw[very thick] (0,0) -- (4,0);

%   \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
%     \item Consider the following conversation between two students:
%     \begin{description}
%       \item[Student 1] ``Acceleration is derived from velocity, which is equal in magnitude at
%       both instants.  That means that the ball has the same acceleration at both times.''
%       \item[Student 2] ``That's right. In fact, if the ball has the same speed at both
%       instants, then the force of air resistance is the same as well, so the net force is the
%       same at both instants.''
%     \end{description}
%     In the space below, write down whether you \textit{agree} or \textit{disagree} with each
%     student. Be nitpicky! \vfill
%     \item Draw separate free body diagrams for the ball (i) immediately before it reaches the
%     ground and (ii) immediately after it leaves the ground.  Clearly label each force. \vfill

%     On the basis of your results, at which instant is the acceleration of the ball
%     \textit{larger} in magnitude: (i) just before it reaches the ground, (ii) just after it
%     leaves the ground, or (iii) is it the same at both instants?  Explain your
%     reasoning. \vfill
%     \item Refer again to the two statements from part 1.  Do you agree or disagree with each
%     statement?  If you disagree with any of the student statements, identify the
%     \textit{specific} error in reasoning used by that student.  Discuss your reasoning with
%     your partners. \vfill
%     \item As the most common strategy to solve differential equations is to make
%     simplifications and reduce your system to a familiar form, what sort of candidates make
%     sense to match your predicted function? List a few here
%     \vfill
%   \end{enumerate}
% \end{enumerate}

% \newpage
% For the remainder of these exercises, we will consider the motion of spherical objects that fall
% vertically in air (or some other viscous fluid).  In such a case, the force of air resistance
% is treated as being:
% \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
%   \item proportional to the speed of the object (with magnitude $c_1\left|v\right|$),
%   \item proportional to the square of the speed (with magnitude $c_2v^2$), or
%   \item a combination of the above two terms (linear and quadratic).
% \end{enumerate}
% where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are positive constants.

% \section{Calculating Terminal Speed}
% In answering the following questions, let vertically downward be defined as the positive
% direction.
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item Suppose that a small ball were moving with downward velocity $v$ (that is, $v>0$).
%   Starting with Newton's 2\textsuperscript{nd} Law, write an equation that includes the
%   acceleration $\frac{dv}{dt}$ of the ball and all relevant force terms ($mg$, $c_1v$, and
%   $c_2v^2$).  In particular, carefully decide the sign (whether ``+'' or ``-'' that belongs in
%   front of each individual term.  Discuss your reasoning with your partners. \vfill
%   \item How would your equation in part (a) be different if the ball were instead moving
%   \textit{upward} (that is, if $v<0$)? Explain. \vfill

%   $\Rightarrow$ \textit{\textbf{Stop here}} and check your results with an instructor
%   before continuing. 
%   \item If the force of air resistance exerted were purely \textit{linear} with respect to
%   velocity ($c_1\neq 0, c_2=0$), use the appropriate equation to express the terminal velocity
%   $v_t$ of the object in terms of $c_1, m,$ and $g$. \vfill

%   Check that your expression for $v_t$ has the correct units.  That is, determine the
%   appropriate units for $c_1$ and confirm that your expression for $v_t$ indeed has the
%   appropriate units for a speed. \vfill
% \end{enumerate}
