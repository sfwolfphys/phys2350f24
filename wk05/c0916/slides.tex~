  \[
    \vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}
  \]
  In Physics \textrm{I}, we usually write:
  \[
    \vec{F}_{\text{net}} = m\vec{a}
  \]
  \begin{block}
    {What questions are we trying to answer with this equation?}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Given all of the interactions of outside systems on an object, how is that object
        moving? (Momentum, acceleration, velocity, position).  
        \item Given the motion of an object, what are the interactions that cause it to move in
        this way? (Find the net force, or how a specific force interacts with that object given
        other known forces)
      \end{itemize}

    {Does $\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} = m\vec{a}$?}
    In a word, no.  But for many problems, yes. Since momentum is:
    \[
      \vec{p} = m\vec{v}
    \]
    We can take the derivative.
    \[
      \dot{\vec{p}} = m\dot{\vec{v}} + \dot{m}\vec{v}
    \]
    By definition $\vec{a} = \dot{\vec{v}}$.  And most systems in Physics 1 problems are
    constant mass systems.  (Really, all this means is that we aren't doing rocket science.) So
    $\dot{m} = 0$.  And we are left with:
    \[
      \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} = m\vec{a}
    \]
    for constant mass systems.

  {Problem type 1:}
  \begin{block}
    {Know the force, find the motion} A block with mass $m$ slides down a inclined plane that
    makes an angle $\theta$ with the horizontal.  What is the magnitude of the acceleration of
    the block as it slides down the ramp? You have consulted a table and found that this
    particular block has a coefficient of kinetic friction of $\mu_k$ with this ramp.
  \end{block}
  Interactions:
  \begin{description}
    \item[Gravity] Force that the earth exerts on the block.  Magnitude: $mg$, direction:
    ``down''
    \item[Normal] Force that the ramp exerts on the block. Magnitude: $N$, direction:
    perpendicular to the surface of the ramp.
    \item[Kinetic Friction] Force that the ramp exerts on the block.  Magnitude $\mu_k N$,
    direction: parallel to the surface of the ramp, going up the ramp.
  \end{description}
  Answer (after doing some math):
  \[
    a = g \left(\cos\theta - \mu_k \sin\theta\right)
  \]

        \[
          mg\cos\theta - \mu_k\mg\sin\theta = ma

        Solve for $a$ and win:

  {Problem type 2:}
  \begin{block}
    {Know the motion, find the force} You are helping a friend move in to their apartment.  You
    are carrying a table together with one person on each side down a hallway moving with
    constant velocity.  If the surface of the table is parallel to the floor, which person is
    carrying more weight, you or your friend?
  \end{block}
  Motion:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Constant velocity, so acceleration is zero.
    \item No rotational motion to worry about.
  \end{itemize}
  Answer:  Since acceleration is zero, net force (and net torque) is zero.  So all forces are
  balanced.  As long as the table is uniform (not thicker on one side than the other) both
  people are carrying the same weight.
